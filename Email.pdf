Subject: Urgent: Report Revision Required

Dear John, I trust this email finds you well. I have just completed my review of the report you submitted yesterday, and I must express my dissatisfaction. The report falls short of our departmentâ€™s standards, with inaccuracies in data representation and numerous errors. This is not reflective of your usual work quality. I request that you revise the report and resubmit it by the end of the day tomorrow.

Best, Robert.
